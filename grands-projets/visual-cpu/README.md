# Visual cpu

(yes i am bad at naming stuff, if anyone wants to change the name, a pull request exists, just modify the name here)

I saw the video of ben eater of the 8 bit cpu, and i want to do the same, but without needing hardware. I want to be able to see the instruction go through the cpu, and use it to understand fully how a cpu works at the lowest level. I will begin with a 4 bit cpu, 8 bit, 16 bit, but I dont think i will go to 32 or 64 bit. If I can to a 32 bit riscV cpu or something like this, it might be nice. I think i will need to remake my asm language, and my compiler.

I want to create this in cpp to learn more about the language.
